#### Project Description
I have many ideas for projects I would like to work on and a lot of them will be built using Javascript.

The aim of this project is to produce atleast one working .js file a day for 365 days, and use the other projects I have in mind as a source of inspiration for the content of the Javascript files.

Hopefully by setting a minimum amount of work to be done each day I will be able to clear out my inventory of TODO projects over time, and create a body of work that I can share in my portfolio.

Eventually I imagine I will create a website that people will be able to use to navigate through the 365 days of the project and view the source code, documentation and examples for each day.

I am going to aim to do 365 days in total, though I might take days off in between those days. And at the end of the 365 days, if I feel like continuing the project past that point I will welcome that decision.

#### Explanation of directory structure
The `common` folder will be used to store common javascript files that are dependencies of one or many scripts in the `days` folder.

The `base_day` folder exists as a utility for when I start a new day. I can copy and paste the `base_day` folder into the `days` folder and rename to the day number and I will be setup ready to go.

The `days` folder contains a folder for each day of the project I have completed. They will all contain an `INFO.js` that will be used when viewing the project with some web application that I will create for viewing the contents of the project.
